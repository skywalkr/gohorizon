	// Multi-session mode for the application pool. An application launched in multi-session mode does not support reconnect behavior when user logs in from a different client instance. Multi-session mode should be disabled when pre-launch is enabled.Default value is \"DISABLED\" * DISABLED: Multi-session is not supported for this application. * ENABLED_DEFAULT_OFF: Multi-session is supported for this application but is disabled by default. The client would need to explicitly request multi-session launch, if wanted. If a legacy client is used, this will always result in a single-session application launch. * ENABLED_DEFAULT_ON: Multi-session mode is supported for this application and is enabled by default. The client can request explicitly for single-session launch, if wanted. If a legacy client is used, this will always result in a multi-session application launch. * ENABLED_ENFORCED: Multi-session is supported for this application and it is enforced. The client can not select to launch this application as a single-session application.
