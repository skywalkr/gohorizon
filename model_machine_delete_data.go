	ArchivePersistentDisk bool `json:"archive_persistent_disk,omitempty"`
	// Determines whether the Machine VM should be deleted from vCenter Server. This is only applicable for managed machines. This must always be true for machines in linked and instant clone desktops. This defaults to true for linked and instant clone machines and false for all other types. If this is true, then machine being deleted must not have any active user session, otherwise delete operation would fail.
	DeleteFromDisk bool `json:"delete_from_disk,omitempty"`
